# BERT-implementation

This repository contains a Pytorch implementation of BERT (Bideirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) from scratch following the architecture described in the original [BERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) without external libraries. 

This repo is simply for the purpose of learning; for me to deeply understand the inner workings of Large Language Models
